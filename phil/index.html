							One time Phil sat and never got up for a long time. He would only consume beer and so only have to urinate, which he used the empty beer bottles for, and would spend all day in his chair even sleeping in it. Eventually his buttocks started to die, the medical term for which is "Anal Necrosis", and had to get a bit of it surgically removed. This is also one of the names Phil is known by.
							<br><br>
							One time Phil confided in Dale and told him how he wanted to have a son, or children in general, so he could raise them to not be a alcoholic neet like him. He then cried about this.
							<br><br>
							One time Phil wanted to e-date Nikola, but things didn't work out because she was into younger boys.
							<br><br>
							One time Phil liked black metal and old rock, specifically "Sick City" by Charly Manson.

							"I had a dream where it was a class project so me and classmates made an aquarium out of different fish things. We had to tape it up on wall. We got bad grade because it didn't have enough green. There were crabs that also made everything go all trippy so we kept hiding the crabs from the teacher so he thought we weren't doing drugs. It was a long time getting aquarium stuff. It was part of the dream too. The other part was on a bridge and there were bugs and monsters under it that kept grabbing people up on the bridge."<br>

							"Alright, so, me, Rain, Yun, and Four were all fishing by a lake when Zero came by, picked us up, and went driving to Dan's house where we played like hide and seek kind of for a bit with old fren called General. Then we went to a beach and it like started snowing and we built giant snowman fish but drama happened and Dan ran after this like loli squirell furry thing. General wasn't there by this point either. Then liked an army of Camps came by trying to steal our fishing rods but then like imagine if Reb was a monkey and a bunch of them came by to fight the Camps so we drove away around mountain but we ran into Nine. Then we argued for a little while before Nine started crying and fainted, so we kidnapped her. I don't know where Yun or Four were by this point but i think they were like chowing down on some food at the beach still. So we accidentally kidnapped Nine and started running away to the North Land and Nine woke up and we got into a slap fight on the road trip before stopping for break where we talked while eating some beans. Then continued more north until Phil came down from the sky like it was the heavens and told me to "Shred brother, lest ye be fallen by the E-Pussy." So I started shredding on my guitar and Four came back and  we played our Chocolate Milk song to big audiance in a stadium, then Five came by and he was like, imagine Bane from Batman. Him and Phil started wrestling but Phil fought with his guitar powers and kept shouting "My anal... NECROSIIISSSSS!!" So we skidoodled on out of there and I don't know where Nine went but we all drove into the sunset, like literally into the fucking sun, with some sad anime ending song playing."<br>

							"I had a dream that I was in my backyard, but like all the nature stuff looked like a beautiful anime, like glowing flowers n stuff, and I was out there walking and there were like glowing butterflies (it was night time), and like I started walking behind the shed when a worm or centipede touched my foot so I screamed. Then I was embaressed about screaming at night so I ran away back into house, then I was on the floor. That's when I woke up beacuse I had a really dry mouth.<br>

							"I had a dream where me and some german dudes plus Adolf Hitler were living at this compound like place kinda in the mountains but not too deep called "The Volksfog" or just shortened to "The Fog". We were like the last people left hiding from these vampires but they could come out in the day and stuff, and we needed to go deeper into the mountains to hide more from them and we had like a bunch of advanced technology and military equipment. We were hanging out when the vampires attacked and they all looked kinda like that werewolf death eater from Harry Potter. After the attack went on for a while we needed to flee so we readied the helicopters to fly away but there were too many vampires and some people wanted to defend the Volksfog. Then Hitler started giving a speech like "My friends and comrades, Don't you know that the Fog was made for you and not you for the Fog?" and literally got in a mech and become Mecha-Hitler from Wolfenstein and started slaughtering the vampires while everyone started flying away. Then me and this german dude made sure we escaped with Hitler somehow and we fled away, and we went deeper into the mountains and started staying at this new house place which was like an abondanded house and were wandering how long until "they" find us. Then there was like a small orange light from a tac hole in one of the closets and a vampire suit on a hanger and I started freaking out. Then my sister woke me up."<br>

							"2/5-2/6/2020<br>
							Nap taken between 5pm - 12:53 am<br>
							I had another dream that i was in a world where people lived among mannequins who acted as human. I was watching or living through the eyes of an old, rich, grumpy man named Dixon. In truth, i don't know if his name is really Dixon. He had a tattoo on his right testicle that marked his name from when he was taken by the other side as a POW.<br>
							Funny i know this because specifically remember this man, after coming back from war, immediately running to an experimental chiropractor to get a massage. He was strapped in a chair made for mannequin carving (he thought it was a really weird salon chair and since it was an experimental place he didn't question it) and when the chiropractor got to his pp area he remembered his tattoo n was so ashamed of it he ran out. I didn't want to include this because i thought it was gross but i must record all dreams as they did without changing material: the chiropractors sliced his p straight down the middle and made a figure out for the tts— the core of his tts were black and iron. He was a war veteran who also hated mannequins. To him, they were an imitation of what it meant to be human and human interactions. Even worse, he felt these mannequins became a distraction from the war. He thought the people who fought in the war were becoming mentally weak because they relied on mannequins so heavily they even married them. But they're mannequins. How can they have real feelings when it is engraved in their computer brains to be human. Does being human only mean having a subconscious? He had loved a woman who had long, beautiful blond hair. It was the color of light corn (haha tf). She had cute doe-like brown eyes and a darker tint of blond for her eyebrows and eyelashes. I don't remember if she had freckles but she was cute either way. I specifically remember her wearing a white milkmaid dress except it was milkmaid from the waist up and flowy from the waist to her ankles. Whenever i think of her i imagine the name Allison so that could've been her name. I also continue thinking she died in a car accident. I wanna say the accident was mannequin-caused but that would be too cheesy and wouldn't fit the style of how my dreams usually play out. He lived in a new york suite with an amazing view of the street below. At night you could see the lights all across the city. A fantastical image i can only see in my dreams. Enough intro. Don't wanna talk about that anymore. HE BASICALLY HATED MANNEQUINS CUZ THEY ONLY PRETEND TO BE HUMAN. Anyways,,,, he meets someone new. I can't imagine how this entity looks at all but i remember it being incredibly positive and trustworthy. A good energy with no malice even i would entrust myself with though it's just a person from a dream. He bumped into this person at the grocery store and the two of them continued to talk from there ((It is possible for allison and this one to be the same person but i don't know— Don't want to call shots where it really counts)). Overtime, he became humbled to mannequins. He didn't detest them anymore and understood other things could have feelings too. One day, he got stuck in an elevator with an elderly woman. He was going down when some rando pushed the woman in and they had to make conversation or else it would've been awkward. The elderly mannequin (they all look human and are usually indistinguishable from humans) was married to human. Yes, she knew she was a mannequin but that didn't change how she felt for the human because she felt human. She told all this to the man because the rando wasn't just some rando who pushed her in. It was the entity who told the woman to go in and solidify his belief that not all mannequins were evil. And she did. She told her story straight on. Everyone already knew her as the first mannequin to marry a human so she didn't need to say much but Dixon did was stand and listen. He was very patient, no tired or exhausted expressions ever made its way to look at that little old, kinda fat lady who was wearing purple and a pair of those glasses with a strap on em. The woman got off. He is heading to the top floor now, ready for important news from a doctor he will meet up there. At this moment, my old daycare counselor Alex and i enter his apartment and kinda just rummage around. There is an open, almost empty juice-jk-it's-san-pallengrino-that-somehow-had-31%-alcohol-with-an-orange-juice-label-wrapped-around-on-it bottle on the counter which i grab and drink from the bottle. Alex was looking through the cupboards. We weren't stealing anything, only searching for something. I don't know what we were doing there but it wasn't super important, Alex seemed to be in a rush.<br>
							He is 3 notches from the top floor. Almost there.<br>
							I have flashes of the stand he was strapped into. It was a woodworking stand for carving dolls. An old man with white hair and a mustache was explaining to me how to use it and shaved down a piece of a doll with it.<br>
							2 notches.<br>
							I was staring at the doll. No impulses. Alex was going through the cabinets hurriedly. I remember an ad for fighter jets in swarms attacking an enemy that wasn't there. There were 4 types for it: swarm, multiple, single-shot, and a fake out. They were all simulated to shoot the target. Ad for the annoying company that makes those replace-the-teeth ads.
							1 level.<br>
							The doors should open soon.<br>
							I understand. Alex doesn't find what she's looking for. The fake out shoots a giant missile that one-shots the target. I set the san-palle down. It's rainy outside.<br>
							The elevator doors open and he walks and sits with the doctor in-front of the large window of a wall and looks straight out. The weather is nice. Clear skies: sunny with birds singing. No smog or a cloud in sight. The doctor looks at him knowingly, as does dixon. He is told he is a mannequin. Somehow, he knew. He is unfazed, this does not change how he views the world or how the world views him. He is just as human as the rest of them. He tells the doctor how he feels. The doctor smiles softly, quietly replies with "i see" and walks him to the elevator.<br>
							Doctor: "it was ..... to ..... you."<br>
							Dixon: "you as well."<br>
							The elevator door closes.<br>
							It descends. He meets with the person.<br>
							E: "i've been waiting for you" it looks warm. The weather outside is asnice as it was at the top floor.<br>
							Dixon: "i know"<br>
							He ends the dream with a mellow smile and walks out of the building with the entity. He loved Allison and he loved the entity in a new-found light. Everything was wrapped in warmth. I believe he was in the elevator to heaven and that explains why it was rainy out in his apartment and sunny in the doctor's room but this is all a dream. He found peace."<br>

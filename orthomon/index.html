						<center><hr><b>Monarchy</b><hr></center><br>
						(Still in draft/hypothetical stage)<br>
						<br>
						To establish one citizens of a region must minimally be generally perceptive and agreeable in establishing a monarchy in the given region.<br>
						To make these citizens perceptive and agreeable more people need to know and possibly be educated on how a monarchy can and is, and is at least possibly a good form of goverment. These messages must come across as a good message and must not come across as ‘brainwashing’ or ‘propaganda’. So to combat this the information and ‘advertisement’ of monarchy that is given must strive to be more objective, honest, and better allow the recipients to come to their own conclusions. This will make the movement and discussion of it more acceptable among the populace.<br>
						The movement and revolution itself will be peaceful as long as those of us who peaceably assemble are not violently infringed upon by any outside force. To make it truly peaceful no one will be forced to be apart of the movement  in any way. Anyone will be able to leave the movement peacefully if they so choose.<br>
						With the first step done of people becoming more perceptive and agreeable to the idea of monarchy step 2 must be underway. While not seceding anything quite yet the leaders of the secession party must organize and recruit anyone who is willing to join the future monarchy to pledge themselves physically and to some extent financially to the party (all of which of course must be voluntary). Once the recruitment step is far enough underway the next step must begin commencement.<br>
						The leaders of the secession party must then designate a general region to begin the process of expansion. The expansion process will then begin through two means. The first mean will be by people who are already within the designated region pledging themselves and all the land they own to be a part of the future country. The second means will be having people who are not a part of the region migrate to the region and pledging themselves and any land they then own to the future country. Once through both means the population and population ratio* as well as the amount of land that will be a part of the new country reaches a certain threshold the process still continues but the secession party along with a requested council of bishops* will then decide who the king/tsar will be, who the dukes will be, and who the counts will be, and how the existing land will be organized into sections and subsections. Then, after all these factors are decided, the secession party must designate what the name of the new country is and officially draft, edit, and send an official declaration of independence chiefly to all known governments the land was previously under, then to other countries for them to decide to recognize or not to recognize the new country. In conjunction with the Declaration of Independence a document of ending expansion must also be sent out. The document must describe a 1 year plan to end landmass expansion of the new nation.<br>
						<br>
						*population ratio - the population ratio is the ratio within the establishing landmass of the amount of people who have pledged to the secession party to the people who have not.<br>
						<br>
						*request council of bishops - a request should be sent out to all patriarchates to send a delegation of bishops and other clergy of how ever many they deem necessary to assist in choosing the king/tsar, dukes, and counts. Once the monarchy is established secondary request for a permanent council of preferably 1 bishop per existing patriarchate, to oversee and decide if any king, duke, or count should be removed.<br>
						<br>
						These are all very raw thoughts to be quite honest.<br>
						<br>
						Naturally when figuring and eventually establishing out a system of government and particularly a monarchy you have to consider multiple factors, the chief factors being: the people family, traditions both religious and non-religious, economy, as well as observations from the past and what worked and what did not work.<br>
						<br>
						One important factor particularly when establishing any government is the establishment of an official national currency. I will get into this topic on another thread probably.<br>
						<br>
						My initial thoughts for a framework of government include a hierarchy of nobles and royalty, needed bureaucracies, a religious council to decide to remove or keep monarchs and nobles when they may be unjust rulers, a military force, a judicial system, as well as a police and peacekeeping force.<br>
						<br>
						The hierarchy of nobles would be, from the top down, the king, dukes (regional), counts (county), knights (mayoral). Any additional ranks can be added if absolutely needed. The ideal ratio in my mind of each rung of noble to the next would be maximally 1:5 and the less rungs the better. Ideally the closer the monarch is to the people the better. So if a revolution to establish a monarchy is big enough the area may have to be semi-balkanized into different countries with separate kings (ideally in a national union of sorts). <br>
						<br>
						Needed bureaucracies would include agencies similar to fbi, secret service, irs, sec, cia, etc. as well as a law advisory board to the king to suggest needed laws.<br>
						<br>
						The religious council is essentially for removal of unjust, or heretical rulers. It would be headed by the Orthodox Church.<br>
						<br>
						The military force would follow a hierarchy of natural promotion, with the king, dukes, counts at the top positions with all except the king having non-nobles having military ranks equal to theirs. This can of course be fine tuned.<br>
						<br>
						The judicial system will have judges and justices directly being appointed by the king, dukes, and counts. The king serves as the Chief Justice.<br>
						<br>
						Normal police and peacekeeping force, (possible military collaboration?) prison system, and rehabilitation system.<br>
						<br>
						Church-state organization will be an organization which regulates(to a slight extent), helps, and allows, churches to assist their communities, families, the poor, hungry, orphans, widows, and elderly.<br>

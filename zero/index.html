					<blockquote>
						the environment I live in is odd. the people who have the most authority are my mom and sister. a recent argument with my sister brought to light an argument with my mom way past that gave me a similar conclusion about their mentality. my sister told me that I "brought to light a lot of dark truths about herself" and blamed it on me, and in not entirely realizing the implications of this I explained my outlook and that I often sought to be more self-aware and understand my problems better and assume most are that way as well, to which she took offense to until I insisted it wasn't meant that way. similarly, in an earlier talk with my mom I mention things I dislike about myself and she responds "and you're proud of that?", which in retrospect would seem to imply that she associates self-awareness with pride. it's a far less-than-comforting thought to realize my mom, sister, or anybody could not only lack self-awareness but idealize it and reject anything that would force them to second-guess themselves. in a neutral context I could mark it down as merely the langauge/thinking of ego/pride but when I thought about it at first it was a brutal realization.<br>

						pattern recognition is my big thing ig. knowing psychological concepts enables me to see those patterns in people in the hopes to betterclarify or understand the way people think, perhaps to supplement my inherent lacking cognitive empathy. it's a great cope for me in this sense, for instance systemizing vs empathizing is a convenient guideline to define what ideas or concepts are more masculine or feminine in nature, or the way men or women are more likely to think. it's easier to talk with my sister knowing that to her her feelings are real and that disagreements with her are mostly regarding that her feelings are hurt somehow

						a mountain lion in general can trust another mountain lion. similarly, a deer can trust another deer. can a deer trust a mountain lion though? trust is entirely subjective, and usually based around similar aims. lack of trust can also lead someone to be untrustworthy. if I try to pet one of my cats, she usually goes to scratch me. I can't trust her not to scratch me if I try to pet her. yet when I look in her eyes when she looks at me, I see a deep fear of me, as if she fears I'll hurt her somehow, even though that was never my aim. being mean or untrustworthy to me is perfectly justified in her mind because of this fear. people usually don't usually admit to being mean or rude, they have their own justifications for their actions. whether these justifications are rational is the question

						&gt;Are you religious? Why, or why not?<br>
						no. I used to be a proud atheist, now I just don't care. I probably should be though. there's yet another pattern I noticed. there seems to be two opposing ideas that can be applied to a wide range of concepts: the difference between skepticism and faith. this can be extended to, for one, dissociation vs flow, or generalizations of them. I talked about flow before here, and how it affects general happiness. in earlier days of human history man only experienced the flow state, then over time to become more self aware, snapping out of this flow state into a more introspective and perhaps dissociative state. you can relate this to the first model since in flow they don't think or question things, they just do what they feel to do to survive or whatnot, a faith in their duty to survive perhaps. the dissociation naturally brings skepticism of their identity and purpose. so faith is very useful to happiness and fulfillment just like flow is, just as skepticism is useful in and of itself. it's much easier to follow a path if you have faith it'll lead to somewhere good, but at the same time you can't just walk along it blindly in case it may lead you off a cliff. people need some sense of faith, some sense of security they can depend on, or at least they would be much happier with it. besides religion sources of faith can include passion or other people. having faith in people breeds dependency, as they can't always be there for you or maybe they change somehow. faith in passion implies faith in oneself, and if you fail yourself it breeds disappointment and self-loathing. in this way religion makes a lot of sense, since you depend on things fixated and unchanging: consistent and reliable. I should be religious. I put my faith in others way too much for my own good, and I don't live up to my passion standards at present. but with religion also comes more sources of judgement, usually by people of other religions<br>

						according to this article one of the biggest factors that prevents people from making friends today is lack of trust, or more generally, skepticism. perhaps people are skeptical others will betray them because those others, in turn, are skeptical of them. skepticism and thus paranoia breed more paranoia and lack of trust<br>
						someone also once told me that schizophrenic behavior and thinking is greatly affected by society. he claimed that middle eastern schizophrenics are happy and that schizophrenics of ancient societies were soothsayers, and compared that to schizophrenics of modern day 1st world societies, such as Terry Davis. Terry Davis had faith in God and his passion, but also incredible paranoia, likely from pervasive societal pressure. if he had been born in a more faithful time or place, would he have been less paranoid or skeptical?

I remember at one point the captors are eating and this one pajeet comes to shit on my lap while I'm sitting down and I just let him because I figured that was the smart move while captive. at another point they're circling around us while we're sitting with some cutting tool that gets closer and closer to us and we have to scootch inward to avoid being cut. eventually I'm in a car with their supervisor (apparently female) and another person in charge, and they're almost onto something I've hidden but I don't remember what I was hiding or why<br>

						&gt;do you feel guilt, do you accept it or do you try to get over it or mayeb u doint<br>
						I feel lots of guilt, too much at times I think. I think in the past I became guilty for things I shouldn't have, like standing up for myself. it's all subjective though. you could feel guilty for hurting someone, maybe what you thought was hurting them was justified because they hurt you. maybe they didn't know they hurt you. maybe they did know and pretended not to. maybe they did and thought it was justofied themselves. maybe you both hurt each other and are guilty. is there some objective fault? who knows. from the empathic angle the fault would lie in any party that hurt the other person's feelings.  to my sister, to criticize my mom when she's entitled to criticize me would be mean and I would be at fault. my mom's fragile ego would be empathized with, despite it being harmful to me. finding the guilt in conflicts has been rather difficult to say the least<br>

						excessively so. what people think of me affects me greatly. my opinion of someone depends a good deal on what they think of me as well, such that if someone likes me and I see them as flawed I'm more likely to see their flaws as something that could be acknowledged and improved on perhaps, whereas if they dislike me I'm more likely to think they can't improve and should be avoided/discarded. people tell me they like me, or they respect me, or that I'm well liked in general. It's difficult to believe, or trust thinking either they're lying to make me feel better or gain my approval or that someday they'll randomly change their mind about me, maybe because of something I do that they never tell me about

						random thoughts<br>
						I seem to just notice patterns in people nowadays. consider for instance the difference between someone with an uppercase name and a lowercase name. I notice that typically men or people of some self-importance have capitalized names, while women, people of less self-importance, or alts, have lowercase names. trannies seem to be mostly uppercase, but could go either way. naturally there are exceptions to this, perhaps a woman with more masculine interests has a capital name, perhaps a man with more feminine interests has a lowercase name. I further equate it to an expression of either masulinity vs femininity, dominance vs submissivity, or pride vs humility. the capital main account vs the lowercase alt account suggests pride for the former and humility for the latter, as the alt isn't meant to be detected or important. the exceptions I've seen where most alts are uppercase seem to suggest they treat all their alts as equal, having equal identity importance, or all lowercase in one case, suggesting similarly but that the identity isn't that important. dominance vs submissiveness and masulinity vs femininity seem to be interconnected but not always lining up per their order. trannies are especially interesting here considering how supposedly they're meant to be effiminate yet the capitalized name suggests otherwise. seems likely it could indicate either a taste in submissive men or women, both indicating dominance. I like thinking of things in these terms.<br>
						neurologically masculine (systemizing) vs the neurological feminine (empathizing) is particularly interesting since now when I think of ideas or look at things I can define them in those terms. logos and pathos are examples of this systemizing vs empathizing in persuasive terms, in essence theoretically you could tell what argument would work better with a woman or a man based on it. it's not so easy to define dominance vs submissivity in these terms though. submissivity is backed by a strong desire to be pitied, while dominance is backed by a strong desire to be respected. you could argue that a woman could better empathize with a submissive man since he desires this pity, while a man could use logic to determine if a dominant woman should be respected or not. this clashes with traditional gender roles, however.<br>
						the more I think on it though, the more I think this may apply to their children more than the partners themselves. the best way to define traditional gender roles I think is in observing instinct and the duties men and women performed in civilizations of old. someone once told me that men have an instinct to protect women. an instinct further defined perhaps by needing to defend family from predators and competition, and to be dominant and feel deserving of respect makes sense here when you think this and of their duties as providers in hunting and gathering in that it drives them to need to feel further respected. the submissive need of women to feel pitied also makes sense here since it latches onto the instinct of men to pity and protect them. so thinking in these terms a woman will respect a dominant man, then after it's established he's dominant she can empathize with him. conversely, a man may come to pity a woman, then eventually come to respect her. as parents the systemizing and empathizing roles become more apparent. the father figure is a being of brutal honesty and thus logical order and systemizing, desiring his children to be strong and worthy of respect, while the mother figure is a being of empathy, being there when children have emotional issues and to feel cared for. when you combine systemizing vs empathizing with dominance vs submissivity and defining them in terms of instinct and traditional gender roles it becomes possible to justify any number of epic gender realism blackpills.<br>
						that leaves the untouched comparison, pride vs humility. the last thing hayashi wrote in his journal is a line from a mobile game he showed me called alter ego: my cowardly pride and haughty shame. essentially these statements describe the effect of having a large ego with little self-respect to back it up, a la narcissism. you put on a mask of being a strong and courageous person while being internally weak and easily offended. pride like this genuinely disgusts me. the worst part is perhaps their response to criticism. instead of defending themselves they turn it onto you and say that you're attacking them, thus victimizing themselves, being perfectly reserved in criticizing you to this end as well as in other places. I don't think I like pride/ego at all if it turns people into pretentious easily broken faggots like this. I respect humility to this end, though I don't consider myself particularly humble. I have a strong desire for positive attention and respect that I loathe. 4chan culture reflects the ideals of humility in that not only are you anonymous by default but namefags, tripfags, and avatarfags are scorned, all people expressing some identity and thus ego. in this way, only the most self-respecting egos remain, those that can withstand the criticism of standing out.<br>
						by corollary, lolcows deserve to be laughed at as well. much in terms of lolcow behavior I've observed is some great ego around themselves and the lack of self-awareness surrounding it. anything they do can be rationalized with the underlying basis being wholly their self-interest. they may criticize you for laughing at them, or talking about them even to minimize the exposure of their terrible behavior. I've seen them use labels like "dramafag" and "snake" towards people who talk about them to imply that those people are the ones creating the drama when in reality they create the drama and people naturally talk about it: a blame shift. you can typically tell when according to them everyone must be in the wrong and not themselves at all. some may think it's mean (mostly women), but the purpose of laughing at them isn't really to hurt them personally, but to implicitly teach them either humility or self-respect in a brutally honest way. to them though, it makes more sense to me now that it could feel like an attack since it harms their ego, which to them is brutally real and cannot be criticized, much like emotions to women, to which I say as much as emotions and ego are real and respecting them yourself is important, also important I feel is recognizing when they're irrational and get in the way of proper functioning.<br>

						remember that as much as anyone can define the reality of conflict in psychological terms, so can the narcissist define their own perception of reality in psychology terms based on their twisted version of reality centered around themselves. projection and victimization are their greatest weapons. they could rationalize victimization by claiming others are rationalizing, they could project their insecurities by claiming others are projecting their insecurities, all to support a worldview that everyone is out to get them as people naturally criticize their narcissistic intent. as they say if you can't beat em, join em. when you can't reason with the narcissist, the only thing left to do is learn from them, in any way possible.

						&gt;When was the last time you cried? what made you do it?<br>
						been crying a lot lately tbh. I can't stop thinking about one person, even dreamed of her last night. I can feel her drifting away farther and farther now. I felt it often even as we interacted, but that the more it happened the more she was tugged back. perhaps she's gone now, perhaps she was gone awhile ago. I feel she's drifting away from the hard truths and rejection of impulse and influence she used to admire, or only said she did, to being a victim of those very things, making terrible choices to which I could do nothing but sit back and watch as she did them. they tell me eventually she'll come back, but that doesn't seem to match my experience. I wish I could know if not so I could finally let go. perhaps in the end I'm a retard for thinking I could help her out of unhealthy thought patterns in the first place, or a simp for trying to help her at all.<br>
						specifically though, it happened today. my mom saw my cut scars, and asked if I felt like doing it more and I said yes, or at least scratching my face. I told her some of my difficulties online and when I got to her is when I cried<br>
						theoretically I should be happier now. I made two wins online I had been fighting for a lot. one of them was making amends with old friends after we grew to hate each other. seems like all through my time on Discord I've been wandering through places of comfort until my inevitable exile or its  inevitable destruction. I re-entered a place that was once of comfort by making these amends, but now it seems foreign and empty to me, perhaps I feel vulnerable there as well. things feel empty now.<br>
						&gt;How would you describe your relationship with your family? Are you close to them at all or have you ever been close to them? What kind of relationship do you wish you had?<br>
						I don't think I'm really close with them. sometimes I have moments with my mom like I talked about above, though it's really difficult to talk to her when I know how full of bullshit she is. today before the talk she "joked" about my sister trying to attack her. I know from previous interactions she irrationally thinks my sister is out to get her and interprets harmless things as attacks that allow her to victimize herself, so I "joke" along with her about how she's a victim of us attacking her. as someone once said to me, ironic shitposting is still shitposting, or more accurately conveyed, irony has some basis in reality. my sister I've come to more recently for issues, though somehow I relate to her less than my mom. my mom seemingly has barely any friends besides family, isn't so keen on talking to people, and will listen to my psychology rants without great hesitation, while my sister has several friends, seems to like talking to people, and doesn't want to listen to all my psychology rants despite wanting a minor in it.<br>
						as for my dad, he's completely something else. he's like a stereotypical liberal facebook boomer and has the sense of humor of a 5yo with random phrases and body movements as well. sometimes it's nice to talk about technology with him, but sometimes he gets things so wrong it's ridiculous. normally he's calm but sometimes he gets randomly pissed at things that don't really make sense to get mad about. him and my mom seem to make really terrible financial decisions, for one deciding to move to an expensive 2 story house 30 min away from anywhere useful with expensive satellite internet as the only internet option. both would rather cheap out on things and go through them it seems as well, quantity over quality. him and my sister seem to relate well though, both fans of b movies for one, though she still complains to me about him. brings me back to how my sister is odd regarding my mom, since she seemed fed up with how she deflects and can't be reasoned with yet still empathizes with her, responding to my plans regarding how to expose her mental gymnastics by saying that thay would be really mean. I heard bpd women love narcissists, and I think I can see why now. they can empathize with the deep insecurity and weakness they see inside while presenting an appealing strong and protective front, even if they end up hurting them. empathy is really weird.<br>
						I don't know what to make of it all. the least normalfag of the family, my mom, is also the most overprotective and controlling. in terms of role models it's really confusing since my dad is basically irrelevant, my mom can act like either a father or mother figure, who knows which when, and my sister is motherly but she's not really part of it mostly. I don't know if I want a better relationship with them. I think I'd rather live on my own with a new family to escape their terrible financial decisions and fragile egos<br>
						&gt;Describe something you hate.<br>
						simps and victimizing faggots like I said above<br>
						remember the difference between a bro and a simp. a bro will talk you up to women, a simp will talk you down to make  them look better in comparison. a simp will also more likely believe shit women will say about certain men and more easily discard them than a bro.<br>
						&gt;Describe something you love.<br>
						I'm not too sure about this one, I don't think I love many things. I think I love to accomplish things and get things done, have something to be proud of myself with. think that happened yesterday working on a command-line game in assembly, trying out vim instead of some gui tool I'm used to was comfy as well. I think in general I love things that make me feel good about myself. perhaps that's selfish of me. it's difficult to put in the effort to love something that has no benefit like validation in loving you back or accomplishment<br>
						<br>
						something else I thought about. in resolving the two great online problems, I found that approaching them from an empathic standpoint worked better than from a logical one. for the first one, after trying over and over to explain my position, eventually he told me I should've just told him how I felt about the situation. for the second I decided to open up more, to which they responded the best to and were willing to apologize to me, and me to them. empathy really is the strangest. I thought more on it though. maybe to women and some others, emotions, intents, feelings, and therein empathizing and thus that which is neurologically feminine, is more real to them than logical order. it makes sense when you consider that what people perceive must be real to them, even if that perception is exaggerated by emotion. I remember someone once argued that women are more interesting than men because while you could ask men about their interests and they could tell you more interesting things about it perhaps than women, a women could tell you about fantasies. seeing as fantasy is a fictional recreation of the emotions, intents, and feelings of people, women would have strength here. you could argue that fantasy is irrelevant but there's a reason people read books isn't there? or in fact, any entertainment medium. you could learn more about yourself by looking at the interactions between fictional characters and seeing what resembles yourself. perhaps women are the best suited to write stories determine whay kind of people people are in thay case. there's a reason why women seem to love psychology. the downside of this is that in that emotions and intents are the most real to women, they see it as the most real in others, and thus unalterable. in this way I believe they would sooner discard someone who has undesirable traits of this nature than see it as something fixable.<br>
						I think this relates to another observation. the masculine way of dealing with problems people face seems to be to bully people out of it, letting them know implicitly that unhealthy or weak mindsets or behaviors aren't okay and won't be tolerated but that it's okay if they're acknowledged as such and worked on: a cruel kindness, while the feminine way seems to empathize with the weakness and show care and let them know that it's okay. which of these works seems to depend. worst case scenario some people can get really dependent on the empathy and use it as a cope and reject the harsh truth of bullying entirely, while others accept the bullying and never open up while rejecting the empathy. which is good for who is difficult to determine. while empathizing can help on the way to healing problems, it can create dependency, opening up a more opportunities to be wounded. bullying can help to gain stronger ways of dealing with adversity, but hurt in not being immediately appealing and potentially making people withdraw further into a mask, only delaying the inevitable and not solving any of the insecurity

					<b>§ Thursday, 30th of April</b><br>
					<blockquote>
						there's a difference between that which is neurologically masculine and that which is neurologically feminine. what is neurologically feminine could be described as looking at the world through an empathizing lens: such that they see the world as intents and emotions, and in extreme cases applying them to inanimate objects. what is neurologically masculine is looking at the world through a systemizing lens, or seeing the world as systems and patterns. you can apply these ideas in many places, for instance logos is to make a neurologically masculine argument, while pathos is to make a neurologically feminine argument. at the extremes of these patterns of thought are such mental disorders as aspd and autism on the masculine side, and bpd on the femine side. you can back these up by observing what hormones contribute to the development of these disorders: the male sex hormones testosterone and cortisol for aspd, general androgens for autism, androgen being a general term for male sex hormones similar to testosterone, and female hormones estrogen and progesterone for bpd.<br>
						I believe it can be determined the extremes of what is neurologically male and female from observing how people with these disorders behave and think. characteristic of the borderline is a lack of intrinsic identity. in this way they tend to mirror others to gain some sense of identity for themselves. irony and larping are also commonplace for the borderline in this way, as it's easy for them to play pretend without knowing if they actually stand for anything. there are two who made journals here expressing how they have no idea who they really are, and the people on Discord I see change their name/pfp the most are women, borderlines, and younger people (having an unstable identity out of lack of mental development). along with this is of course their incredibly unstable emotional state and their incredible emotional neediness. the ideal world for the borderline is one where everyone loves them and they know it, but naturally that's not possible so they must cope however they can. in these ways, to be neurologically feminine is to play pretend, to not stand out and be a social chameleon for fear of your identity being attacked or criticized, and to justify behavior based on how you feel and your emotional state. on the flip side of the coin is the neurologically masculine, seeing things in patterns and mechanically. the autist will systemize at a low level, such that inherently systematic lines of thought such as math and coding may come naturally to them. the sociopath is systemizing at a higher level, such tha patterns in human nature are predictable to them. they are not empathizing like the borderline, so they are emotionally detached from most things, thus using things and people is justifiable to them as self-interest and that they would lose nothing emotionally from it. the sociopath can systemically break down morals into component forms of self-interest, for instance one would not convince somone to suicide if them being alive is of their self-interest.<br>
						I was rather purturbed when my sister criticized my tone when I asked her to adjust something and I asked her if she was offended and she was and I said she shouldn't get so offended over something like that and she said you can't criticize how someone is feeling and didn't speak to me for the rest of the trip. I didn't tell her then that my mom always demands things on her boat trips to people in a less than polite tone because it's of necessity, just as I was busy driving and had little care to be polite but to get things done in the moment. I do tend to feel offended like her when my mom does it but I know it's irrational because shit needs to get done, and I wasn't trying to offend my sister I was trying to help her by getting her out of a pattern that would end up hurting her in the long run if she keeps getting offended by such small things.<br>
						I believe now emotions are a curse, only serving as an avenue for weakness and narcissism. some may say narcissism is healthy in small doses or a sign of strength, I say narcissism is weakness under the guise of strength bu discarding those that make you most weak. I could try to get any number of borderlines I've interacted with out of terrible patterns that would only end up hurting themselves in the end and they would end up hating me or trusting me less. I truly hate the neurologically effeminate since in justifying things based on emotion they are justifying things based on irrationality and bullshit. and I know I'm little better as I have this bullshit as well having strong emotions as an autist. seemingly to be the most rational you have to be the most neurologically masculine, ala the most sociopathic. but sociopaths are dangerous because they discard the natural moral framework humans base their behaviors around to be trustworthy. if there was no moral framework, no emotions to be trampled upon, would they be dangerous? if everyone was a sociopath would things be better? perhaps not, as they are narcissists and dependent on control and self-interest, and narcissism, as I said, is weakness. autism could qualify, autists are weak by measure of social cunning but would be irrelevant if everyone was an autist. in the end they are still weak in the neurologically effeminate aspect by having strong emotions. thus we look unto the way of the humble schizoid. the schizoid is indifferent to emotional or ego needs, and thus is lacking of social weakness. an ideal, productive society then would be one comprised of autistic schizoids, lacking in social and emotional bullshit and only getting things done

						Describe your current mental state<br>
						paranoia, maybe lacking. my mom has pressured me so much into doing homework and making threats and being unable to reason with her I grew intense frustration and perhaps a chronic tension headache. the paranoia stems from her being there constantly in my mind, waiting for me to fall even a little bit behind to threaten me again. if I lash out in frustration she plays the victim and blames me yet again.<br>
						the paranoia now extends to online interactions as well. frequently I see with interacting with borderlines there is no way to win. if you fight, they're a victim, if you back down, you're a coward, if you get mad, they're rent free. and seemingly I can't get away from them, people keep bringing them back, enabling them, since they can't see how anyone could possibly fear them. and them bringing them back into conversation is a painful reminder of my shortcomings: how could I have argumentated harder to get them to understand? could I have perhaps even helped the borderline out of their bullshit if people didn't enable them? people seem so easily influenced now, I feel I would be discarded by any community a borderline has a foothold in. more recently a conflict arose seemingly forcing me to choose which of two people is more borderline as well. perhaps my increased emotional state is a result of someone opening me up and making me vulnerable. I don't think I've been as comfortable talking to anyone else, but I wonder if it was a mistake to have even been friends with them in the first place, yet I wouldn't have learned nearly as much then. one of the key points of no game no life is that because imanity is weak, they learned to gain wisdom and experience to see through the tricks of stronger races. in a similar fashion, I believe it would do good any autistic male to learn psychology against what are in comparison to him a world full of psychopaths and narcissists. despite all the tricks up my sleeve, I still have much to learn and experience, and am thus theoretically powerless against them, and thus, paranoia

						What does it mean to be close to someone or something?<br>
						this one always stumped me. in hs normalfags seemed to be close in the sense that they knew things about each other, went to each other's houses, etc. I figured in friendships I tried to make there was something I was missing, like I was aiming for something closer but I figured the closest someone could be was in romance, otherwise what was the point in going out of my way to try to bond with people? for this reason I was very "tfw no gf" in hs. I had a oneitis I was obsessed with, and ofc I was too socially retarded to do anything to further things or actually talk to her but I was very surprised normalfags generally dissaproved of this obsession. what was the point of being romantically intimate if there are no intense emotions or desire? more recently someone said something that struck a chord with me: in comparison to the autist, neurotypicals are emotionally stunted, socially cunning, and superficially charming psychopaths. the emotional stunting can also be seen in relation to other emotionally intense disorders like bpd as well. clinginess and dependency deter neurotypicals, so I feel for emotionally intense people closeness means something different for them, something that perhaps can only be satisfied by intimacy. gunjy and miyako talked a bunch about wanting a friend they could obsess over, whether that friendship was a genuine close friendship or a covert way to describe intimacy I'm not sure<br>
						in general I feel closeness is in knowing about someone's strengths, weakneszes, and flaws, and understanding and respecting them. I'm not so sure about emotional closeness, that seems to be reserved for women, intimacy, and effeminate homosexuals. I read that the female sex hormone progesterone is involved in forming bonds in women and some men, and at the extreme this causes homosexuality in them. so... emotional closeness is perhaps effeminate.<br>
						I don't feel closeness is entirely related to how well you can relate to people but how easy it is to talk to them, which relatability can certainly help with but isn't a guarantee. online I've often considered myself closest to those I have or can talk to the most, because they present the greatest value for me, while there are certainly people I relate to but for the life of me couldn't really talk to that much unless some opportunity presents itself. someone I'm comfortable talking to about anything within a certain category is great for companionship, as there's little effort in coming up with something to say. on the cases of autistic interests this provides a sort of social/intellectual connection. I used to talk to people about more cs and programming oriented things but there are always areas of contention there, and at times I have very little tolerance for being able to respectfully disagree with people so I fear reaching a contention and having the social connection break and ultimately ruin the convo, perhaps because I'm bad at defending my own opinions there, or I have very few strong opinions and wonder why some people are so passionate about something there when I've already given up, though they often wonder the same about me. more recent conversations regarding lore I've been able to defend myself in and I've benefitted from socially.<br>
						at the end of the day I wonder if I only think I desire emotional closeness but would be better off with some social/intellectual closeness in the long run.<br>
						I came upon two things which have shaped my thinking a lot: a video on the benefits of meditation and a documentary called "happy". the meditation video taught me about a mental state called flow: the default mental state of animals and a secondary state for humans. it's a state of incredible focus and dedication to a single task where you think about nothing else and barely even remember it afterwards, as opposed to the normal mental state humans experience. from the documentary I learned that people who experience this state more report happier lives. the more general takeaway I got from that is that being caught up in something without having to worry about anything else is what can make people happy, whether flow or another feeling. the feeling of being caught up in some conversation or social thing can distract me from other woes and produce enjoyment itself, without the need for explicit emotions. as a side effect, I end up caring about these people that can produce this feeling, which brings to mind that caring about people is perhaps part of closeness.<br>
						those I've been the closest to on Discord are few, and more often than not they've reached out to me over me reaching out to them. some provide social/intellectual connection, others emotional, or both. sometimes I wish I had the energy to reach out to people and make more friends but I know they might expect me to keep up the conversation and I don't know if I have the energy to do that. autists tend to form few, but close friendships in any case, due to their social retardation for the former and perhaps because of their emotional intensity for the latter.<br>
						in summary I believe closeness involves any of understanding and respect of people's strengths, weaknesses, and flaws, providing some mutual emotional, social. or intellectual value (someone also told me friendship is about mutual respect and I believe that belongs here in respecting the value they provide), and mutually caring about each other

						who am I? I kept repeating this question in my head over and over. now I have some sort of answer. saturation was a nice mask, I felt comfortable talking to people, asking about them, and genuinely caring about them as this identity, and when people made fun of me they made fun of an identity so I could laugh with them. in terms of post quality I have three main avenues for respect: software autism, lore autism, and psychology autism. the first is largely irrelevant in the communities I frequent but comes up from time to time, I made a friend that way once by teaching him how to change his ip. the second is valued by some but reviled by others, namely cluster b who don't wish their exploits of terrible behavior to be exposed, and doesn't come up terribly often. the third I can apply to nearly any situation provided enough digging, opportunity, and lack of brain fog. otherwise most normalfag talking points elude me unless I have the energy or interest to ask endless questions to get some grasp on the subject matter. under this mask things like that take less energy and generate more enjoyment somehow, as well as greeting people which I was never fond of as I thought the attention was awkward.<br>
						was having a mental breakdown and cut myself before I came to this and I don't know how long this'll last. idk if I like zero, idk if anyone likes zero, idk who zero even is. saturation is nice and caring and generally liked I believe

							I've had two Discord dreams of late: the first a situation similar to one I experienced in a server where everyone was helping me and I left because I got so embarrassed like I was being an attention whore the second I was invited to a server I've been trying to get into for some time. I saw it from a third person perspective in outer space for some reason, where in the background there was a big tree, in the foreground there was a floating platform, on or floating above the platform there was me to the right and this person called Anon with a pfp I recognized. to the left of the tree and the platform was the person who invited me, as a set of two big tubes connected just before the end by some surface that I guess could've been it's face. I got the feeling it was the God here and it created the server as well, so I knew who it represented. I looked into the message history for mention of my name and I found myself being discussed and my attempts to join being thwarted before the dream ended
